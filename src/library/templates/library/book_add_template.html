                This form is useful to you if you have a new book with multiple copies.
                You can add the title of the book, the author(s) (seperated by a comma) and the number of copies.
                you also have to add a book prefix in the format EX1 (so two capital letters followed by a number).
                It must not be the same as another book that already is in the library
